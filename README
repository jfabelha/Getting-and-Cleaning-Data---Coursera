Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
	1.	Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
	2.	Loads the activity labels and the feature info
	3.	Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
	4.	Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
	5.	Merges the two datasets
	6.	Creates a tidy dataset that consists on the mean of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The result is shown in the file tidy.txt.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
